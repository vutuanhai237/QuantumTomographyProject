# Quantum Tomography

- [x] Week 1, 2: Example with one qubit

- [x] Week 3, 4: Example with n qubits

- [x] Week 5: 

- Refactor and make this project as an library
- Create an arbitrary state and reconstruct it

- [x] Week 6: Create a checker to make sure that the initial state is generated randomly

- [x] Week 7: Create general W state
