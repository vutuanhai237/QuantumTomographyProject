# Quantum Tomography

- [x] Stage 1: Reconstructed one qubit state

- [x] Stage 2: Reconstructed GHZ state.

- [x] Stage 3: Reconstructed linear state.

- [x] Stage 4: Create a checker to make sure that the initial state is generated randomly. Create W state, make W checker and Haar checker.

- [x] Stage 5: Create QNG, compare it with SGD, Adam, QNG-Adam.

- [x] Stage 6: Comparing between initial state

- [ ] Stage 7: Tomography
