# Quantum Tomography

- [x] Week 1, 2: Example with one qubit

- [x] Week 3, 4: Example with n qubits, create GHZ state.

- [x] Week 5: 

- Refactor and make this project as an library
- Create an arbitrary state and reconstruct it

- [x] Week 6: Create a checker to make sure that the initial state is generated randomly

- [x] Week 7: Create general W state, make W checker and Arbitrary checker.

- [x] Week 8: Create Quantum Natural Gradient optimizer and compare it with SGD and Adam. Developing some hybrid optmizer like QNG-Adam.

- [x] Week 9: Comparing between initial state
